# Fitness Center Carrillo.

Language en-US

The author designed the website for the customers hoping that all queries about our facilities, and services in Carrillo, Costa Rica, could be answered. The site targets all customers who want to learn about our services and why Fitness Center Carrillo is the best in the region.
# Features
## 1. Existing features:


+   ### The logo and main landing page:

    - The logo was created on the website freelogodesign.org. 
    - Based on the psychology of colors, we used yellow, which represents optimism, clarity, and warmth; green brings peace, health, and growth, and the gray color was used as a background to contrast and relieve the sight. 

    - We also add the name of the logo in a more oversized letter to catch our user's eye and attention. 
    - We have a fixed unfocused (copyright protection) background image, which was acquired from the Unsplash site, about women doing exercise. The image works subconsciously; the user knows he is on a site about the gym, health, and fitness.

+   ### The navigation bar:
    - Offers the user the possibility to travel to the different areas of our website. 
    - It has an active function to let the user know the actual page is visited by underlying the word and a hover function by changing the opposite background color and letter color to allow the user to see when he hovers over an item.
    - It has a home, gallery, and contact tab with icons for accessibility reasons such as dyslexia or analphabetism. It is the same throughout all the website pages to give stability to the user.
    - It has space to give the opportunity in the future to add more tabs if needed.

+   ### The information section:
    - This section is the highlight of the home tab. It summarizes our goal, most essential services, and facilities, which stand out from our competition for the user to acknowledge.
    - It was created from left to right, being the left more important than the right.
    - It has an image of a female doing a squat to emphasize to the user that we are a center of exercise. 
    - It also has a video of Carrillo beach, not just to exercise but to walk, relax and meditate. The video's purpose is to inform the user that a beach is near the Fitness Center Carrillo.
    - In the right section, we have a discount area to attract not only wealthy customers but also the most humble customers. We believe that all persons be affordably entitled to health.

    - This section goes through all the web pages on the website to give routine to the customer and easy access to the user about our schedule, address, email, and telephone number; no need to move from the actual page.

+   ### The footer section.
    - Like other sections of the site, it goes through all our web pages for the same reasons as the others, to make a habit of our web pages.
    - It has our social media links, which open in a different tab, to help the user not to lose our site but also to stay connected with us and informed.

+   ### The gallery tab.
    - It is a small section but essential to show our users our most important facility, the gym section, as it gives an idea to the user of the quality of the equipment and the swimming pool.

# Testing:
   - Using the links provided by Code institute, the author's code was tested rigorously throughout creating a webpage using HTML5 and CSS language. 
   - The author used Mozilla, Chrome, and Safari to test the website on a laptop and a Mac desktop 5k and found a position problem with the laptop and the Mac, which needed to create another media query for users with a high-resolution display and a resolution pixel of more than 1300px. 
 - The background picture went through crop sizing for tablets(768x800px) and mobiles(568x800px). The Gallery pictures stayed at full resolution despite using the picture element with the source attribute failing to react in responsive design. Regardless of the image element with "srcset," "size," and "src" attributes did not contribute further help in responsive design. However, validation did not appear other issues or errors. Media query and TinyPNG were used to resolve the abovementioned problem to have good, no stretched or pixeled images.
 - At first, the author used google icons but failed to create a responsive design. For that reason, another font source like Fontawesome.com was used to solve the problem. The author used version 5 because version 6 was not working correctly.
  - All of the colors used in the site were tested with [webaim](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/).
## Validator testing
- Html
    + No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator.]()
    + No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C CSS validaotr.]()
